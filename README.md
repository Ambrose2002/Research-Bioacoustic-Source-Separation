# Bioacoustic Source Separation and Classification

This project focuses on utilizing bioacoustic data for the separation and classification of various bird species. The provided code enables users to analyze audio recordings and identify the bird species present within them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `birdnetlib` library
- Additional dependencies as specified by `birdnetlib`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install birdnetlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have a suitable audio recording file (.wav format) for analysis.

2. Run the analysis script, providing the path to the recording file as a command-line argument:

   ```
   python analyze_recording.py path/to/recording.wav
   ```

   Replace `path/to/recording.wav` with the actual path to your recording file.

3. The script will analyze the recording and print the detected bird species to the console. Additionally, it will generate a CSV file containing detailed information about the detected species.

## Notes

- Ensure that the audio recording file exists at the specified path before running the analysis.
- Adjust the minimum confidence threshold (`min_conf`) in the code if necessary to refine the detection results.
- The analysis script currently assumes a fixed location (latitude and longitude) for the recording. Modify these parameters as needed for your specific recordings.
